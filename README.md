# Callosum
Callosum is a forthcoming project. Callosum will explore the landscape of cybernetic identity and brain-computer interfaces.

We will explore the dimensionality of cyberspace, interface methodologies, and the representation of the coherent 'self' while projecting onto the 'net.' Additionally, we will try to illuminate potential novel attack vectors brought about through various brain-computer interfaces, as well as possible mitigations.
